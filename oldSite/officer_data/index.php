<H1>Advice</H1>

	<!  THIS SECTION SHOULD BE SHOWN AS: [sender], [MM/DD/YYYY]: [[[ MESSAGE ]]]
               thank You.    -chrisj>


	This section gives advice to new officers from the old officers. This should be a growing documentation
	of the officer's experiences, and an aid in starting the year.

	Andy, 1/9/2001: I was often the leader in the group, so I noticed a lot of apathy from ACM members.
	Many don't have time to work on stuff, many just want something fun to do. Give them something fun to do,
	become their friends, and then you might have their help.

<BR></BR>
	Andy, 1/9/2001: Progress on projects is always slow, so don't get discouraged. Just make sure that work gets done!

	Andy, 1/9/2001: Though pizza feeds can work wonders, you won't always get the attendance you want.
	Buy less than you think you'll need, and emphasize the first come first serve nature of the meeting.

<BR></BR>
	Andy, 1/9/2001: Reel the freshman in during the first or second
	week of school! It's the best way to get them to know about the club!
