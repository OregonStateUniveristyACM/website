<H1>How to get plaques</H1>

<P> Usually, we get plaques for the top three teams that they get to
take home. Something we could do in the future is have a place to list
the winning teams of each year (that's a bit expensive), but maybe you
could hint to the winners that they should consider donating their
plaques to the school...

<P> The place that we've been using is R3Engraving, which you can find
in the phone book. In the past, it's been under the name Andrew Ko (old
president). When you go in, they'll have the plaque design from the
past, and they've made it really easy to just change the year and the
names for us. It's typically been $90- $100, just so you know. It takes
about two weeks to have them engraved, so be prepared for a long wait.
