                <p>Rey Pocius, a native to the Chicagoland area moved to Oregon in pursuit of the growing tech scene in Portland and the thriving programs at Oregon State.

He joined this scene after his freshman year. He landed an internship doing DevOps engineering at a small software startup in Portland called Metal Toad. He gained industry experience and exposure to the lively tech and startup scene there.

Rey took a turn in his early career and pursued research in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) at Oregon State University in the Personal Robotics Lab. During this past summer, Rey interned at the Naval Research Laboratory's Navy Center for Applied Research in Artificial Intelligence as a contractor. There he continued to pursue his research interests in Robotics and AI. He is particularly interested in deep reinforcement learning and human robot interaction.

He is very passionate about informing others about the ever growing tech field and what it has to offer.
