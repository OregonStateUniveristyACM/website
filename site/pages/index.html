            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>ACM is a leading academic computer science organizations. We are a student chapter of the ACM. We really like to think of this group as the OSU computer science club, in which we have events, contests, guest speakers, workshops and give away pizza. In the past, we have had a software engineering contest, sent two teams to the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest, helped out with tutoring for CS 151, had many lectures, and started a x86 Linux cluster in our lounge. This year, who knows!</p>
